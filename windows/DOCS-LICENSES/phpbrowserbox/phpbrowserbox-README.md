## Introduction

PHPBrowserBox is an open source project founded by Anthony Ogundipe in the year 2013 to provide a way for developing native desktop GUI applications using web technologies such as PHP, HTML5, JavaScript, MySQL, SQLite and Google Chrome.

It is a an excellent software for converting web applications written with HTML/PHP web apps and PHP into desktop applications with little effort.

In a certain sense phpbrowserbox acts differently from a PHP to EXE compiler. It embeds a web browser, a multi-threaded web server and a PHP interpreter.
All embedded into a single application, a portable folder that you can easily distribute to end users by packing it to zip archive or by making an [installer for your application](../../wiki/Knowledge-Base#application-installer).

It has been tested with the following php versions :  5.5, 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 8.0, 8.1 and 8.2 on both Windows 7 to Windows 11, 64 bits architecture.

All popular PHP frameworks are supported, see the [PHP frameworks support](../../wiki/PHP-frameworks-support) wiki page.

You can create a standalone executable for distribution with the help of the [Inno Setup installer](../../wiki/Knowledge-Base#application-installer).

PHPBrowserBox is released under non-restrictive license, thus it is [free for commercial use](../../wiki/Knowledge-Base#can-i-use-php-desktop-in-a-commercial-closed-sourced-project).

Lots of other useful information can be found on the
[Knowledge Base](../../wiki/Knowledge-Base) wiki page and on the
[PHPBrowserBox Website](https://phpbrowserbox.com).
